## Version 2.0.0 Released - December 2024

PropertyWebBuilder 2.0 is a major release representing 5 years of development and 500+ commits since v1.4.0. This is essentially a complete rewrite with a modern architecture.

### What's New in 2.0

**Architecture Changes:**
- Converted from Rails engine to standalone application
- Full multi-tenancy with `acts_as_tenant` gem
- Dual admin interfaces: `site_admin` (super admin) and `tenant_admin` (per-tenant)
- New property model architecture: `RealtyAsset` with separate `SaleListing`/`RentalListing`

**Tech Stack Upgrades:**
- Rails 5.2 → 8.0
- Ruby 3.4.7
- Bootstrap → Tailwind CSS for public themes
- Globalize → Mobility for translations
- Cloudinary → ActiveStorage (S3/R2 compatible)
- Vite + Vue.js 3 + Quasar for admin panel

**New Features:**
- Seed packs system for scenario-based site setup
- Firebase authentication with Devise fallback
- New themes: Brisbane (luxury), Bologna, Bristol
- Enhanced theming with CSS variables and Liquid templates
- Faceted search with field key filtering
- Comprehensive SEO implementation
- Audit logging for authentication events
- Push notifications via ntfy.sh

See the full [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Motivation

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.


## Demo

<!-- You can try out a demo at [https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com](https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com/)

To see the admin panel, login as user admin@example.com with a password of "pwb123456". -->

There was previously a demo hosted on heroku but since they ended the free plan I have had to take it down.

## Create your own real estate website with no technical knowledge

The simplest way to create a website with PropertyWebBuilder is to use Heroku, a trusted service provider.  They no longer have the free tier which was a great selling point but are still worth trying out.

Just [sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity), click the button below and in a few minutes your site will be ready

Here is a video about how to deploy to heroku:

Thanks to the awesome [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) contributing to the translations is super easy!

- Edit the translations directly on the [property_web_builder](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=property_web_builder) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.
