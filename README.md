## May 2025 update

PropertyWebBuilder is now a standalone Ruby on Rails app (it is no longer a Ruby on Rails engine). It has also been upgraded to use Rails 7 and Ruby 3

I am currently working on a Rails 8 upgrade which will use the wonderful vite-ruby gem to re-implement the admin panel with vue.js and the quasar framework:

https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/tree/vite

Also, I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting and would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

I have auto-generated some documentation using Devin deepwiki which can be found here:

## Motivation

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.


## Demo

<!-- You can try out a demo at [https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com](https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com/)

To see the admin panel, login as user admin@example.com with a password of "pwb123456". -->

There was previously a demo hosted on heroku but since they ended the free plan I have had to take it down.

## Create your own real estate website with no technical knowledge

The simplest way to create a website with PropertyWebBuilder is to use Heroku, a trusted service provider.  They no longer have the free tier which was a great selling point but are still worth trying out.

Just [sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity), click the button below and in a few minutes your site will be ready

Here is a video about how to deploy to heroku:

## Install locally

PWB was previously designed to be included as an engine in an existing Ruby on Rails app. This is no longer the case and you can now run it directly as a standalone app.

It can also be installed locally as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder.git
cd property_web_builder
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails pwb:db:seed
```
